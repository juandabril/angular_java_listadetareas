 # Spring Boot and Angular Integration with Time Variable HTML

This project demonstrates the integration of a Spring Boot backend with an Angular frontend, and it includes a time variable HTML component. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up and running it.

## Overview

The project combines the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- **Angular**: A powerful JavaScript framework for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **HTML**: Used for creating a time variable component in the application.
